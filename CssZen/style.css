Start Mr. Reynolds' Directions:
Make sure you list your color palette colors in the comment below.

You do not have to make comments for the HTML, but every block of CSS on this page needs to be commented on, even stuff that is already here that you don't use.  If you don't need it and don't want to comment on it, then delete it. But if it is here is needs to be commented on.  

Formatting: Make sure all your CSS is uniformly indented
throughout the entire style sheet.  

You need to set fonts and I will search for that, you need more than one image.

You need some kind of special effect, JavaScript or CSS Animation.
Make sure you incorporate C.R.A.P into your design.
