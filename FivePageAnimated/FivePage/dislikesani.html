    <img class="hatedimage" src="images/modern-luxury-display-homes-in-NSW_0.jpg" alt="open concept home" width="500px" height="300px">

    <p>This image is of an open concept home, which is an idea that I don't like.
        I think these homes look strange, and maybe an attempt to be too "modern".
        I think homes look a lot nicer with the divided look of walls seperating all the rooms.
        And in this image specefically, I HATE how almost EVERYTHING is white. The ceiling
        is one thing, but that walls too?? AND THE CHAIRS AND TABLE???? That's just unnessesary. It makes the room painfully
        bright to peoples eyes in my opinion, especially at night.
