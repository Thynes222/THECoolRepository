    <p>This is the title screen of one of my favorite Sonic games, and the first game I remember playing. Sonic 2!
        The game was originally released for the Sega Genesis in 1992, but I played it
        for the first time in around 2014, using the mobile port made by Christian Whitehead.
        As a kid, I played this game for hours on an Amazon Fire Kindle, because that's all it was released on that
        I had access to at the time. I was never very good at it, but I almost made it to the final 3 stages.
